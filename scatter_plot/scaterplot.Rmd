# Basic Scatter Plot

geom_points() is the main function that make the scatter plot of two continuous variable. In the following example the scatter plot from the data set of heightweit {gcookbook} is used.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
    
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(gcookbook)


ggplot(heightweight, aes(x = ageYear, y = heightIn)) +
        geom_point()
```

### Grouping Points Together using Shapes or Colors

visually group points by some variable (the grouping variable), using different shapes or colors. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggplot(heightweight, aes(x = ageYear, y = heightIn )) +
    geom_point(aes(colour = sex, shape = sex))
```
